## __*About me*__
> *<p style="tect-align: justify"> So far, I have successfully worked in the banking and financial industry for more than 15 years with companies and private clients. My previous work experience remains in history, because I have decided to change my profession to Front-end developer. This is my biggest challenge in life and I will definitely achieve it. Starting from January 2022, I am learning programming by self-learning using courses: Linkedin.com, Udemy.com and youtube.com. At the given moment, I started training in the RS School program: JavaScript Mentoring (Basic level). I'm open to everything new. </p>*
